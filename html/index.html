				<p id="text">Meet Runt! This sweet and affectionate girl absolutely adores head scratches and snuggling up for pets. Runt is curious and playful, always ready to explore or chase a toy, but she’s also a gentle soul who loves her cozy downtime. Temptations and gravy treats are her favorites, and she’ll be your best friend when those are around!</p>

				<p id="name">Name: Taiga</p>
				<p id="text">Taiga's a lover, not a fighter. He gets along well with kids and dogs - a total sweetheart! He's FIV+, so his ideal family is one that will take good care of his health and make sure he stays up to date on yearly check-ups and vaccines. Love him, and he'll love you in return!</p>

				<p id="name">Name: Minnie</p>
				<p id="text"> Meet Minnie! She is a super sweet senior who just LOVES to cuddle and have all of your attention! Minnie loves affection and will drool to show it while you pet her! She would be a great addition to anyone looking for a lap kitty who has lower energy levels. Minnie does fine with other cats but chooses not to interact so she would love if she was your one and only!</p>
